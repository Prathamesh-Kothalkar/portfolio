## What is an ATS?

ATS stands for **Applicant Tracking System**. Itâ€™s software used by companies to **filter**, **track**, and **evaluate resumes** during the hiring process.

Basically, an ATS helps recruiters decide if your resume aligns with the job requirements. It scans your resume, **extracts content**, and matches **keywords** from your resume with the job description.

Your resume might not even get to a human recruiter if it is not formatted properly or contains the wrong keywords. ATS optimisation is therefore essential.
